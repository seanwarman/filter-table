# BMS Frontend

Welcome. The current most up-to-date branch is `dev`. The stable branch 
is `staging`. The `master` branch should generally be the same version 
as `staging` but it's not being used at the moment so if often outdated
and should generally be ignored until it's needed.

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
