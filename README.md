A React, Redux filtering table example, using an Express api with
a MYSQL db.

Note. this version is hosted with a free db so fetch speeds are a little
bit limited.


Features:

- Cross option filtering over multiple database table columns
- Filter option counts, to predict filter results in advance of choosing
  them
- Bulk editing and bulk comment functionality
- Ability to save and recall any number of filter options
